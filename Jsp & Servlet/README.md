## ‚öôÔ∏è **Project Features (Review 3)**

### 1. **Create and Configure Servlets**
The following servlets are implemented for handling form submissions:
- `AddBookServlet.java`
- `AddMemberServlet.java`
- `AddLoanServlet.java`

Each servlet handles `doGet` and `doPost` methods for managing the respective entities.

### 2. **User Forms for Adding and Managing Data**
The application includes the following user-facing forms:
- **Add Book**: Allows administrators to add new books by providing book details (Book ID, Title, Author, etc.).

- **Add Loan Record**: Allows administrators to record loan transactions by entering Loan ID, Book ID, Member ID, and Due Date.

### 3. **Integrate JSP with Servlets**
Dynamic JSP files are linked to servlets for a seamless user experience:
- `addBook.jsp`
- `addMember.jsp`
- `addLoan.jsp`
- `manageBooks.jsp`
- `manageMembers.jsp`
- `manageLoans.jsp`

### 4. **Dynamic Data Display**
